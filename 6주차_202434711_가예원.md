## 1. Initializing a Repository
- `git init`
  - Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
  - Creates a `.git` directory to start version control in the project.

## 2. Checking the Status of Your Repository
- `git status`
  - Displays the current status of the working directory and the staging area.
  - Shows which files are tracked, modified, or untracked.

## 3. Adding Files to the Staging Area
- `git add [file_name]`
  - Stages the specified file for the next commit.
  
- `git add .`
  - Stages all files in the current directory (new, modified, and deleted files) for the next commit.

## 4. Removing Files from the Staging Area
- `git rm --cached [file_name]`
  - Unstages the file but keeps it in the working directory.

## 5. Ignoring Files
- `.gitignore`
  - Specifies files or directories that Git should ignore.
  - Use this file to exclude unnecessary or sensitive files from being tracked.

## 6. Committing Changes
- `git commit -m "commit message"`
  - Commits the staged changes with a descriptive message.
  - The commit message helps in understanding the changes made.
